            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>Amares is a chill, down-to-earth girl with a passion for the occult and the ability to predict the future through communing with spirits. She's a lover not a fighter and this is obvious given that she prefers using her powers only to keep herself out of harm's way or playfully messing with people, but recently she's had to use them to fight. Despite her mischievous streak and vanity, she's generally caring and gets along with most people thanks to her easy-going nature. Though at the bottom of the cast system of her planet Amares is seen very highly in the underground world of witches on account of her being the direct descendant of the most legendary witch to ever walk the planet, simply known as "La Brujota"</p>

                <P>Amares has long black hair that falls messily down her back, usually left unbrushed, giving her a wild and free-spirited look. Her skin is a smooth and unblemished light gray color as is the norm for her species. Her wardrobe consists mostly of black clothing, with a few splashes of gray or red here and there. She favors ankle-length skirts, often layered over fishnet stockings, and pairs them with comfortable, yet stylish gray sandals. Her crop tops range from simple black tees to more elaborate pieces, such as the pentagram strap croptop she's usually seen wearing.</P>
